<h2 style="font-family: 'arvo';">Success Story...</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Noto Sans';"><q>Denis Arslanovic came to the United States in 1997 at the age of eight, as a refugee from Bosnia. He came with his mother, father, brother, and sister. Denis attended Wilson School in Moline. He moved to California with his mother at the age of 16. Denis was given 10 years “refugee status”, and after ten years, Denis was expected to go through the naturalization process of gaining citizenship. Denis came to the United States at such a young age, he was never educated about the process, neither was his family. In Denis’s heart he was an American citizen. At 18, Denis realized that he needed to get citizenship but didn’t realize the urgency or severity of the issue, so he put it off. When Denis was 20, he was finally confronted by a judge and was sent to the Eloy Detention Center for illegal immigrants in Arizona, where he stayed for nine months. Shortly after he was released, he moved back to the Quad Cities. Now Denis started working on the process of becoming a legal citizen, but all his efforts where to no avail; he was beginning to give up hope. Denis saw a flyer for the “New Americans Initiative” a forum hosted by QCAIR on December 3, 2013 to educate immigrants and refugees on the process of becoming an American citizen” Denis met I.K. Oriaikhi, Executive Director for QCAIR, for the first time at this forum. QCAIR had never been confronted with this type of case, so I.K. Oriaikhi, reached out to service agencies in Chicago that work on cases like Denis’s. In her search she met with Michael Gosch from “Interfaith for Detained immigrants” in February, 2014. Through QCAIR’s partnership with “Interfaith for Detained immigrants” we were not only able to extend Denis's court hearing from 6 months to a year, but we were also able to start his work authorization permit process. Denis obtaining a work authorization permit would show the U.S. Immigration Services (USCIS) that he is a productive member of the community/society. QCAIR sent a letter of support, along with letters of support from members of the community to USCIS. Finally, on March 2, 2015 Denis went to the USCIS office in Naperville  for his biometrics, the first step in receiving his work authorization permit. Denis is now waiting for USCIS to adjudicate his application.</q></p>
