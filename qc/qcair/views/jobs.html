<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Nato';">Jobs/Employment Team</h1>

<p>One area that Immigrants and Refugees have difficulty with is finding a job or employment. QCAIR has recognized this shortfall and created a job/employment team to assist with the securing jobs. This is a difficult issue for most immigrants and refugees, as they frequently don’t have references or a prior work history that can be verified. Other issues include not having experienced the hiring process or knowledge of how to dress. QCAIR has and is working to overcome this problem, by becoming the reference for the immigrant and refugee and partnering with other agencies to teach what to expect. Among the agencies we have partnered with are Dress for Success, Rock Island Housing Authority, and the Quad Cities Times newspaper. These agencies and companies have help us teach a series workshops on subjects such as how to fill out job applications, how to write and present resumes, allow immigrants and refugees to experience mock interviews with employers and learn how to dress for interviews. </p>

<p>QCAIR has undertaken a recent effort that has met with some success.  We have partnered with local employers, such as hotels and small factories, to directly connect our clients and employers. One area that frequently works against immigrants and refugees, is when they don’t speak English. When we refer a client to a potential employer and our client doesn’t speak English, we provide an interpreter for the interview. We are currently looking for additional employers who are willing to participate in this program. In order for this to continue being successful, we are in need of volunteers. We need volunteers to meet with prospective employers, to identify what type of jobs they have and the type of work.</p>
