		<h1 style="text-align: center;">Positive Interaction with Police</h1>

		<hr>
<p>As the Immigrant and Refugee populations continue to grow in the Quad Cities area, the Positive Interaction with Police <b>“PIP”</b> Action Team greatly appreciates the opportunity to join with local law enforcement and assist with their transition to residency in Rock Island and the Quad Cities.<b>“PIP”</b> is a committee consisting of volunteers dedicated to providing interactive educational opportunities to adult and youth Immigrants and Refugees.  We promote cultural awareness and tolerance, support equal educational opportunities and encourage respectful interaction between all people and police officers. </p>

<p>
	The <b>“PIP”</b> Action Team, together with the support of the Rock Island Police Department, is dedicated to provide awareness and knowledge of local laws through interactive educational opportunities called Community Forums. <b>“PIP”</b> provides a non-threatening atmosphere to talk about basic laws which include topics on Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), court proceedings, traffic tickets or citations, as well as, information about laws relating to child abuse, domestic violence, etc.  Such collaboration with the Rock Island Police force gives us hope to building better relationships and more communications in the future.

</p>

<p>
	To schedule a community forum, please contact Marsha Jones, chairperson, at (309)794-3569. The office is located at 1800 3rd Avenue, Rock Island, Illinois 61201.<b> “PIP”</b> is happy to host community forums for Immigrants and Refugees providing a comfortable, non-threatening “safe zone” to talk. Participants are encouraged to question local law enforcement about the judicial system, police practices, and the laws.<b> “PIP”</b> will provide refreshments, child care (if needed) and answers to questions. We foster on-going communication during non-crisis situations to build trust, mutual understanding and cooperation between, Refugees, Immigrants, Police and Quad Cities’ residents.
</p>

<p>
	The <b>“PIP”</b> Action Team has been involved with and served the community with forums for the past four years providing Cultural Sensitivity Training, and collaborating with many establishments throughout the Quad Cities to spread the mission. 
</p>

<b>PIP Mission Statement:</b>

<ol>
	<li>Will outline a methodology to share information about our local judicial system, police practices and the laws with different ethnic groups</li>
	<li>Will foster on-going communication during non-crisis situations. </li>
	<li>Will build trust, mutual understanding and cooperation between police, refugees and immigrants.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Additionally, the <b>“PIP”</b> Action team has been successful with the unveiling of the Language Resource Card Project (LRC). The LRC Project was designed as a tool primarily to aid law enforcement officers during traffic stops. <b>“PIP”</b> believes this tool will help reduce language barriers in the community; saving time and energy spent trying to understand non-English or limited English speakers while conducting business in the Quad Cities area. The Language Resource Card is approximately the size of a driver’s license.  It has been designed to identify the card holder, the card holder’s language and origin, and identify two of the card holder’s personal contacts who can speak and understand the English language and who have agreed to interpret.  It does not grant any immigration or legal status and is strictly limited to listing persons 18 years and older as a contact source. While the card’s intended application was for interaction with police, the <b>“PIP”</b> Action Team sees the implications growing much further than this. Hospitals and local businesses can all benefit from the LRC Project. We believe the Language Resource Card is a positive step in the right direction with the opportunity to welcome newcomers to the Quad Cities area. 
If you’re interested volunteering with the PIP team or knowing more, please send an email, via our contact page, attention: Marsha Jones.
